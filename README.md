# React Guild Framework

Every details of this framework is up to the guild itself to decide, are intended as suggestions.

## Example agenda for a standard meeting:

Each meeting and its agenda is published as an issue in this repository.
Each meeting has a theme that is decided on beforehand. To keep the sessions focused, each activity is timeboxed.

1. **Roundtable sharing** - Goes around to everyone who wants to share something exciting they have seen, something they worked lately or a cool code pattern they are utilizing.
2. **Spotlight** - Someone selected on beforehand showcases some work that they have done which they are proud of, want feedback on or is interesting.
3. **Best practices** - Discuss and review best practices. These are published in an accessible location for all who might need them. There should atleast be one person responsible for preparing something for this each meeting.
4. **Package review** - Reviewing the “tech radar”.
5. **Whats new** - Share the latest and greatest from the React world. Does not neccessarily have to follow the theme of the meeting.

## Output of a meeting

1. Deciding the “theme” for session on beforehand (E.g forms, state, styling). For example creating a plan for the next 6 months to reduce the amount of organizatory work needed before each meeting.
2. Deciding which person should present in the spotlight segment.
3. Select an area where we want to produce best practices, e.g forms. Editing existing best practices based on feedback from the guild. Deciding who is in charge of doing this.
4. Adjusting the tech radar and deciding who is responsible for making the change.

## Output of the Guild

1. A collection of best practises which are maintained by the guild.
2. Organizing social events related to React, E.g NextConf. Also organizes a yearly trip to a React convention.
3. Maintains a “tech radar” or recommendations for which packages to use for which purposes. This is especially important considering that the threshold for selecting new packages is rising with new demands for compliance and security.
4. As the organization grows (especially with large geographical distances) there might be a use case for publishing some sort of newsletter with the latest news, or recommending existing ones. At this point of time the guild will probably be pretty small (<10) and all who are work with React in any way will have good possibilities of participating directly in the guild.

## Other details

1. I suggest having a monthly meeting. With people being split geographically it would also be nice to organize a biannual physical meeting.
2. The initial meeting will be vital as we want everyone to share the same ambition for the group.
