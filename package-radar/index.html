          <h3>What is the Package Radar?</h3>

          <p>
            The Stacc React Package Radar is a list of technologies,
            complemented by an assessment result, called
            <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following
            semantics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high
              confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale.
              Technologies with a usage culture in our Stacc production
              environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work
              with success in project work to solve a real problem; first
              serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
              limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some
              engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
              knowledge and experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising
              and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to
              invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has
              impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often
              brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find
              some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote
              it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping
              effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be
              used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet)
              worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used
              for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing
              projects.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

          <p>
            The package radar is supposed to help you to find the right react
            package for your project. It is based on the
            <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar"
              >ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a
            >
            and the
            <a href="https://engineering.zalando.com/tags/tech-radar.html"
              >Zalando Tech Radar</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

          <p>
            The Package Radar is maintained by our
            <em>React Guild</em> &mdash; who are people at Stacc that are
            enthusiastic about React and want to share their knowledge with
            others. We meet every month to discuss new technologies and packages
            that we think are interesting and should be included in the radar.
